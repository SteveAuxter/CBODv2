# Introduction
ChromeBooks On Demand version 2 (CBODv2) is a utility that uses device information exported from Google Workspace and presents it in an easy to use webUI.

CBODv2 is written in PHP/HTML and uses a SQLite database to store device info. You can run CBODv2 on just about any webserver with PHP enabled.

CBODv2 requires a working instance of GAMADV-XTD3 (https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3/releases) on the same webserver.

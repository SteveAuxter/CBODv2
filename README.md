# Introduction
ChromeBooks On Demand version 2 (CBODv2) is a utility that uses device information exported from Google Workspace and presents it in an easy to use webUI.

CBODv2 is written in PHP/HTML and uses a SQLite database to store device info. You can host CBODv2 on just about any webserver with PHP enabled.

CBODv2 requires a working instance of [GAM7](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3/wiki/How-to-Install-GAM7) - formerly GAMADV-XTD3 - on the same webserver.
